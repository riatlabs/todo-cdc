** TODO Update Blender plan
  Pre-38C3 plan available at https://transfer.adminforge.de/fCkFcJwkGA/cdc-38c3.blend
  1. Make it match the actual CDC layout at 38C3.
  2. Add benches.
  3. Add trusses.
** TODO pretalx to C3 hub importer
  Create a script that grabs talks and workshops from [[https://pretalx.riat.at/][our pretalx]] and pushes them into the [[https://git.cccv.de/hub/hub][C3 hub]].
  Pretalx has a nice API: [[https://docs.pretalx.org/api/fundamentals]]
  The C3 hub API was quite incomplete at 38C3, check current status: [[https://git.cccv.de/hub/hub#rest-api]]
  fluorescent_beige gave it a try. Ping him.
** TODO Up next screens
  During 38C3 Voboda developed a website that grabs JSON from the pretalx API
  and shows the "up next" event happening on a given workshop area/talk stage.
  We had it running on a Raspberry Pi in kiosk mode connected to a screen.
  It also displayed a QR code linking to a form where last minute events could
  be proposed.
  Improvements needed for 39C3:
  - Show more than one future event
  - Add QR code linking to full programme
  - Adopt 39C3 design/theme (when released)
